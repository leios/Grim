# Chapter 3: Red

TODO

It wasn't I was roughly seven that I had seen a human face in its true form.
This is the story of that event.
This is the story of my grandmother.

We sat in the clearing, backs against the tree, facing Shika's remains.
It had been a full year since we had buried her, but it still felt like something was missing between us.

Lately, Jackie had taken up drawing.
I would write, and she would draw whatever I was writing about.

Sometimes, she would start and I would write about her drawings.

The image of my grandmother's face was burned into my mind.
I found myself looking into mirrors at the grey haze that was my face and trying to draw in where I expected my eyes, nose, mouth, and ears to be...
Entire mirror completely covered in permenant ink.

Father was furious.

I figure if I cannot collect myself, I should at least do what I can to tell the stories I can.

Ears... Mention how far off they are from the scribbles he drew.
He thought they would be much farther away when he was younger.

Also mention that he started making a coffin, but similarly to his writing, this one was special and hard to get right.
It was meant to be a representation of *him*
