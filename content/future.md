Sequel:

Grim's future

Just before dying on the final day, a little girl knocks on his door and asks him to come talk to his parents.
He does so, only to see that they will both die soon.

He agrees to adopt the little girl and when he returns home, finds his eyes missing again, but this time, shaded [insert color].

The story shows him slowly regaining color back and becoming human by living with his adopted daughter.
