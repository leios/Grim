# Chapter 8: Black... or white?

Jackie's death.

___

This was 5 years ago.
The day I began writing my memoir.

That said, I managed to write 2 chapters today.

When I woke up in the mirror, I looked into my own eyes for the first time.
My pupils were surrounded by an amber ring which faded quickly into blue...

Describe full face through scribbled mirror.

Even though this is the face everyone knew me as, I did not recognize it at all.
It was weird to see the muscles flex as I moved it around.

Impostor syndrome?

I suppose this book will never be published after all.

I only wish I could have finished that coffin before today.
