2. My grandfather

I have always found books and the written word to be an utterly fascinating avenue to explore the thoughts and opinions of the human psyche.
In every story, tale, and prose, authors focus on different aspects of their characters and environment.
I suppose this holds true for any form of creative content.
If two creative people are tasked at describing the very same setting, with every single aspect of the scene identical to the other, they will still lead their audiences along two radically different stories.
In one tale, a starry sky represents the endless depths of human curiosity, while for others it could represent a prison, constraining our reality, everything we have come to understand, to a certain set of principles we call "Earth."

For me, I was particularly interested in how humans described other humans.
An author might depict a "furrowed brow" or "eyes as sharp as a knife's edge," but what do these actually mean?
How can a brow furrow?
How are eyes sharp?
I understand simile and metaphor, but as a human without the ability to perceive faces, these seemed impossible to grasp.

The more I read, the more interesting these stories became, and I was particularly drawn to authors who could intricately weave a web of words, catching their audience's attention with simple, yet intricate prose.
As such, I, too, began to write.
Every day, I would write more and more into a notebook.
It would be hard to call it a diary, as it was closer to an anthology, but inside those stories were my innermost thoughts and opinions.

I truly felt drawn to the pen, and found myself at my most human when expressing myself in works of fiction.
To this day, I feel the best way to capture a thought is through prose.

At the time, I found myself reading and repeating my favorite authors in my own work, and yet I never fully grasped human interactions.
I didn't truly know if a lip could furrow or a nose could purse.
I kept feeling my face, with a dictionary in hand, trying to figure out what was possible.

It wasn't I was roughly seven that I had seen a human face in its true form.
This is the story of that event.
This is the story of my grandfather.
