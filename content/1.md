# Chapter 1: Shika

I don't have too many memories of my youth, but I have always been particularly fascinated by animals of all sorts, and they, too, were fascinated by me.
Even though humans are frightening to most creatures, I am hardly human, myself.
There is a sort of kinship shared between us non-humans that is hard to properly describe, but here I am tasked at explaining precisely that.

I suppose the best way to do so is through a story of my earliest friend.

It began when I was around five and we lived in a somewhat rural community, and our backyard was surrounded by a dense forest.
One morning, I sat at the kitchen table and began inspecting the treeline.
I think that was the first moment I ever stopped to appreciate the beauty of nature.

The sky was dark as gray clouds slowly churned above crisp green trees.
Their needles formed a red bed through which critters scurried about.
On one trunk, a squirrel scurried with a nut in it's mouth, pausing to breathe and survey for predators.
On another, a hole had formed for blue birds to nest.
The chicks chirped and chirped, waiting for their mother to return.

It was all so crisp. So real.

I then looked back to the table before me, illuminated only by the window.
It was gray, along with every other object in the kitchen.
There was no movement.

My father was in the other room, reclining on a gray couch, reading a gray newspaper in his gray attire.
I saw the paper lower a bit, revealing his Gray haze.

The two worlds could not be further apart, and at the time, I knew where I wanted to be.
So I did what any five-year-old with no sense of danger would do: I ventured into the forest.

Okay, it wasn't much of a venture, honestly.
I jumped from my chair, opened the door and just... walked.
The grass was unexpectedly tall because I was quite small at the time, and as I approached the treeline, I heard all the creatures of the forest singing their songs.
The birds were louder, bugs were humming, and I soon to heard rustling in pine floor as a chipmunk came out of hiding.
It sniffed the air, scouting for danger before approaching in short bursts of speed.

I crouched down and stared.
It stared back.
I think we were both lost in wonder and curiosity -- neither of us could fathom what, exactly, we were looking at.

I glanced up, only to see something else in the forest, a young doe.
It was large, much larger than anything else I had seen at the time.
It's hide blended in perfectly to the pine needles, which might have been why I missed it before.
It approached me slowly, one step at a time until it's face was right next to mine.

From its black eyes, I could see the entire world's reflection.
Green grass, gray clouds, and myself... Somewhere in-between the two.

I instinctively reached my hand up to it's snout, feeling it's fur and immediately knew its name: Shika.
I scratched its chin a bit, and it nuzzled my arm.

At that time, for the first time in my life, I felt perfectly understood.
I suppose this is why it is still one of my fondest memories. 

Suddenly, I heard the door crack open from the house and my father call my name.
Shika ripped herself from my arms and glanced at my father in panic.
I could feel her fear as my father approached.

"Shoo." He said, waving his hand impertinently towards Shika.

She responded by stepping towards the forest before he pulled me into his arms. "Don't go wandering off. You had me worried."

As he walked towards the house, my eyes were locked on Shika.
We had only just met, and I was already afraid of losing her.

The closer we approached the house, the sounds of the forest became fainter and fainter, until they were silenced completely with the door's click.

My father held my shoulders firmly and said, "Don't play with animals. They could hurt you, and we wouldn't want that." He paused, "Look at me when I'm talking to you."

I didn't understand what he meant at the time.
I _was_ looking at him, his legs anyway.
It took me years before I learned that when people ask you to look at them, they are actually asking you to look at their face, specifically.

Throughout the years, Shika and I would continue to meet.
Sometimes, it would be a simple passing glance from the other side of the window-pane, but other times, I found myself venturing out against my father's will.

See father, no face...

So there I sat, beneath a tree, covered by a patchwork quilt of light and shadow dancing about the forest bead from the shifting foliage above.

...

In the end, I suppose that was my first coffin.
The thing that started it all.
