# Chapter 1: Shika

I don't have too many memories of my youth, but I have always been particularly fascinated by animals of all sorts, and they, too, were fascinated by me.
Even though humans are frightening to most creatures, I am hardly human, myself.
There is a sort of kinship shared between us non-humans that is hard to properly describe, but here I am tasked at explaining precisely that.

I suppose the best way to do so is through a story of my earliest friend.
It's strange, at that age, I only have wisps of memories, small daydreams that cannot tell a cohesive narrative; however, this memory is strong and vivid.
It still feels like a huge, pivotal moment in my life, even though it happened when I was a child.

It began when I was around five and we lived in a somewhat rural community, and our backyard was surrounded by a dense forest.
One morning, I sat at the kitchen table and began inspecting the treeline.
I think that was the first moment I ever stopped to appreciate the beauty of nature.

The sky was dark as gray clouds slowly churned above crisp green trees.
Their needles formed a red bed through which critters scurried about.
On one trunk, a squirrel scurried with a nut in it's mouth, pausing to breathe and survey for predators.
On another, a hole had formed for blue birds to nest.
The chicks chirped and chirped, waiting for their mother to return.

It was all so crisp. So real.

I then looked back to the table before me, illuminated only by the window.
It was gray, along with every other object in the kitchen.
There was no movement.

My father was in the other room, reclining on a gray couch, reading a gray newspaper in his gray attire.
I saw the paper lower a bit, revealing his Gray haze.

The two worlds could not be further apart, and at the time, I knew where I wanted to be.
So I did what any five-year-old with no sense of danger would do: I ventured into the forest.

Okay, it wasn't much of a venture, honestly.
I jumped from my chair, opened the door and just... walked.
The grass was unexpectedly tall because I was quite small at the time, and as I approached the treeline, I heard all the creatures of the forest singing their songs.
The birds were louder, bugs were humming, and I soon to heard rustling in pine floor as a chipmunk came out of hiding.
It sniffed the air, scouting for danger before approaching in short bursts of speed.

I crouched down and stared.
It stared back.
I think we were both lost in wonder and curiosity -- neither of us could fathom what, exactly, we were looking at.

I glanced up, only to see something else in the forest, a young doe.
It was large, much larger than anything else I had seen at the time.
It's hide blended in perfectly to the pine needles, which might have been why I missed it before.
It approached me slowly, one step at a time until it's face was right next to mine.

From its black eyes, I could see the entire world's reflection.
Green grass, gray clouds, and myself... Somewhere in-between the two.

I instinctively reached my hand up to it's snout, feeling it's fur and immediately knew its name: Shika.
I scratched its chin a bit, and it nuzzled my arm.

At that time, for the first time in my life, I felt perfectly understood.
I suppose this is why it is still one of my fondest memories. 

Suddenly, I heard the door crack open from the house and my father call my name.
Shika ripped herself from my arms and glanced at my father in panic.
I could feel her fear as my father approached.

"Shoo." He said, waving his hand impertinently towards Shika.

She responded by stepping towards the forest before he pulled me into his arms. "Don't go wandering off. You had me worried."

As he walked towards the house, my eyes were locked on Shika.
We had only just met, and I was already afraid of losing her.

The closer we approached the house, the sounds of the forest became fainter and fainter, until they were silenced completely with the door's click.

My father held my shoulders firmly and said, "Don't play with animals. They could hurt you, and we wouldn't want that." He paused, "Look at me when I'm talking to you."

I didn't understand what he meant at the time.
I _was_ looking at him, his legs anyway.
It took me years before I learned that when people ask you to look at them, they are actually asking you to look at their face, specifically.

Throughout the years, Shika and I would continue to meet.
Sometimes, it would be a simple passing glance from the other side of the window-pane, but other times, I found myself venturing out against my father's will.

A few years later, my father no longer kept a close watch on me and instead spent all his time in his workshop, building some new contraption of sorts.
I had taken up writing.
I would spend hours a day inscribing my thoughts on paper, listening only to the muffled whirring of my father's tools.

To this day, I have always found books and the written word to be an utterly fascinating avenue to explore the thoughts and opinions of the human psyche.
In every story, tale, and prose, authors focus on different aspects of their characters and environment.
I suppose this holds true for any form of creative content.
If two creative people are tasked at describing the very same setting, with every single aspect of the scene identical to the other, they will still lead their audiences along two radically different stories.
In one tale, a starry sky represents the endless depths of human curiosity, while for others it could represent a prison, constraining our reality, everything we have come to understand, to a certain set of principles we call "Earth."

At some point, I remember trying to describe something as simple as a tree.
Where do you start?
From the trunk, panning upwards to the branches or the other way around?
What kind of tree am I creating?
Should it bear fruit?
Should it harbor animals?
Should it be blooming or barren?

I simply did not know, so I looked to the treeline and described every color that stood out.
Green and brown needles.
Blue sky.
Grey shadows.

Shika.
There, in the shadows stood the only creature I could ever call a friend staring intently at the house.
I wondered whether she was looking for me or angry at my father for making so much noise and I suddenly became rather irritated at the noise myself.

I looked down to my notebook and tried to write, but nothing came to mind.
I was too distracted by something I had not even thought about moments before.
I remember a wave of emotions ran through me in that instant, and before I knew it, I was out the door and walking to the woods with my notebook in-hand.

As I approached, my father's workshop became more and more distant, drowned out by creatures of all kinds humming and singing their various songs.
Shika and I were both silent observers.
As I approached, she approached me and nuzzled my arms like always.

Various other woodland creatures came to welcome me as well.
Squirrels, rabbits, birds, all watched curiously as I approached and seemed to welcome me to their home.
The contrast was jarring.
I felt like their home was my own as well.

Shika lifted her head and turned towards the treeline, beckoning me to follow, and I did.
Her footsteps were quiet, almost silent, careful not to disturb the ambiance of the forest.
I tried to follow her guide and lifted my feet a bit higher to keep from rustling the earth.

So there we were, two friends exploring the world together.
In hindsight, it probably looked rather comical.
A deer, majestically gliding through the forest, illuminated by specks of light piercing through the foliage above, and myself -- a lanky child, dressed from head to to in gray awkwardly lifting my legs with an unnatural gait to keep myself from clumsily disrupting the environment.
I knew I didn't belong, but I wanted to.

Maybe that's why no one seemed to mind my presence.

We continued into the woods, deeper and deeper until I could no longer see my home.
I remember stopping a few times to do a few odd jobs.
I gave a squirrel a nut and helped a chick back to its nest.
Shika seemed to be a guardian of the forest and led me to woodland creatures requiring humanoid intervention.

At some point, we stumbled upon a clearing.
It was almost a perfect circle, filled with grass and a single tree at the center.
It's branches extended far and wide.
It felt like the tree, itself, was some ancient or respected veteran in the forest, deserving a space alone.

Shika shook her head stretched her shoulders before laying in the sun while I made my way to the tree's trunk and pushed some dirt around for a place to sit.
We sat in silence for a long time, just relaxing and absorbing each other's company.
There were no rustling creatures or chirping birds, and it felt like civilization was too far to even fathom.

Somehow or another, I found myself returning to the exercise I had before: trying to properly describe a tree.
I looked around and tried to pick out the most important colors.
Green trees and grass, blue sky, brown deer, gray...

Grey what?

Between trees in the distance, a gray haze appeared, and at the time I had never seen anything like it.
It seemed lost, wandering to and fro, sometimes pausing at a tree before leaping to the next.
I found myself oddly captivated by it, constantly watching and wondering where it would go.

Soon, it stopped and leaned slightly.
It, too, seemed captivated by something.

Slowly, it began to come closer and closer until it entered the clearing.
Shika lifted her head, but didn't seem frightened, so I figured there was nothing to fear.
It paused in the sunlight before approaching Shika, enveloping her in gray mist.

It then paused again before approaching me, too.
It moved like a human, each leap deliberate and meaningful.
It kept walking closer and closer until it was about a body-length before me and stopped.

I couldn't take my eyes off of it.
Up close, it was not too different than it was from afar.
It was a deep, opaque gray mist, slowly drifting into the sky like a the smoke from a bonfire that had just been extinguished.
It was almost identical to how I perceived human faces, with the clear distinction that this object was, for some reason, completely and utterly invisible to me.

I silently wondered whether this being could speak... if it somehow knew about why I was unable to see faces.
I quickly dismissed these thoughts, but became inspired to write a new story.
If I remember, it was about a blind boy who could only see things illuminated by his guide.
It was crude and an obvious allegory to my own predicament, but sometimes it's nice to express yourself through fiction.

As I began to write, the mist shrunk a bit, seemingly squatting and staring straight at me.
It then crawled next to me and nuzzled itself against my left arm.
Unlike Shika, the haze didn't seem to have any fur, but instead felt more like cloth.

I remember being distinctly frightened at the moment, but looked to Shika to see whether I was worrying too much.
I saw her ear flick away a fly, but she saw no obvious form of danger, so I figured whatever this thing was next to me, it was not likely to be harmful.

So there we sat for what felt like hours while I wrote my story.
I would look up every now and again, and then to the mist before writing.
After a while, I came to enjoy its company as well.

I felt like everything was how it was meant to be without a human in sight.
Before I knew it, we had fallen asleep and the sun was nearly setting.

I stretched and stood, waved to the creature, and had Shika walk me home.

When I shut the door behind me, my dad asked where I had been, and I proudly responded, for the first time in my life, "With friends."

"Good for you, son!" He said, obviously cheerful, "You should do that more often."

So I did

The next day....

Shika: With every step, a blue wisp launched from her hoof...
In the end, I suppose that was my first coffin.
The thing that started it all.
