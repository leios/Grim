# Chapter 1: The first coffin

I don't have too many memories of my youth, but I remember being particularly fascinated by animals of all sorts, and they, too, were fascinated by me.
I suppose my earliest memory was when I was 6, maybe 7?
It's strange, I remember it so vividly, yet I don't remember any specifics outside of happening.

At the time, we lived in a somewhat rural community, and our backyard was surrounded by a dense forest.
One morning, I sat at the kitchen table and began inpecting the treeline.
I remember thinking about how vived the colors contrasted each other, from the bright green grass, to the pine trunks, and tumultuous sky.

It was all so crisp. So real.

See father, no face...

So there I sat, beneath a tree, covered by a patchwork quilt of light and shadow dancing about the forest bead from the shifting foliage above.

...

In the end, I suppose that was my first coffin.
The thing that started it all.
