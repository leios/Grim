# Grim

When I was three, I was diagnosed with prosopagnosia, the inability to discern facial features.
To me, the human body stops from the shoulders up, and the head is replaced with a grey smudge.
It's like the artist who paints reality on my eyes was stricken by the sheer complexity of the human face.
After all, most expressions of emotion and empathy are conveyed on that very canvas, and how could anyone truly capture the true beauty of the human soul?
The artist might try again and again, constantly redrawing the head to be all shapes, sizes, and styles before giving up and dabbing it over with whatever paint they have left.

I know what the doctors said.
I know that what I am about to say does not make sense.
The problem is that people with prosopagnosia can at least still *see* faces. I cannot.
For this reason, I have a different idea.

See, there's this thing called synaesthesia where certain individuals are able to hear shapes or taste colors.
It's a blending of their senses and their perception of the world is fundamentally different than those around them.
I think my prosopagnosia is actually a very rare form of synaesthesia.
At first, I thought that I associated personalities with color, and I think I was partially right.
I associate something with color, but it is certainly not personalities.
My prosopagnosia seems to be connected to the individual's life force.

That is to say, if someone is far from death, I see a gray haze around their face, obscuring their facial features, but as their death draws nearer and nearer, I begin to discern more and more until I can see them perfectly and they are a corpse.
I guess I always had trouble communicating with people because of this.
On the one hand, I knew when others were talking and could definitely tell when they were agitated or joyful from their voices, but I could never see their faces.
There was always a missing element to our conversations.
I suppose because I was incapable of truly understanding the expressions of others, I became somewhat expressionless, myself.
In fact, by the end of kindergarten, even my instructors referred to me by a rather fitting nickname: Grim.

I didn't mind the constant teasing so much, after all I had no empathetic connection to anyone.
When I finished high school, I quickly became a mortician.
At least then I could see people for who they truly were, in more ways than one.
Unfortunately, I had no idea how to dress a face to look presentable for a funeral, so I quickly failed at all aspects of the job, except one: coffin sales.
Because of my unique perception, I found that I could make a living creating and selling luxury coffins, and I began to focus all of my attention towards that.

The locals took notice of my abilities, and because I was naturally quiet, they associated my voice with the death of their loved ones.
I wasn't well liked, but I was certainly needed.
Eventually, everyone took my word as law.
If I wanted to sell to them, they would purchase the coffin and quit their job.
At the very least, they knew their death was soon.
No one was left guessing.

One afternoon, I was walking down a rather busy street, attempting to find new customers when a somewhat obnoxious man with a gruff voice shouted, "Hey Grim!"
He ran up to me with his blurry face and tubby belly and asked, "When am I gonna die?"

"You still have some time left." I said.

"Phew, that's a relief! I thought my wife was going to kill me after today!"
He laughed and his belly jiggled.

I didn't want to talk to him any longer.
I had business to do.
"Look. If you lost your job, she will break up with you, and then you might be a little closer to death and I can see you then."
I chuckled and pushed him aside.

"Wait. Grim. How much closer to death?" He slapped a sweaty hand on my shoulder and I could hear unusually deep concern in his voice.

I sighed and my eyes settled on a cloud ambly drifting above, "Look. What's your name? Bob, Billy...?"

"Jake."

"Ah, yeah, you look like a Jake. I'll call you Billy. You are not going to die soon."

"Great. Thanks a lot Grim."
He stood in silence for a few seconds before continuing, "Hey, are you alright?"

I slowly dropped my gaze back onto the hazy crowd.
Not a customer in sight.
I became somewhat exasperated and asked, "Are you a father, Billy?"

"Why yes. Yes, I am."
He pointed a chubby finger into the crowd.
"There's my daughter, the love of my life!"

I looked in the direction and saw a little girl with blonde hair and freckles all over her... I could see her face.
She had a day or two.
So Billy was a customer, after all!

"Hey Billy. I was thinking about it, you might just want a coffin."

"Haha. Sure! You just said I had plenty of time."
He laughed again.
It was fainter this time.
Nervous.

"Oh, _you_ do. This coffin would be..." I didn't know how to break it to him, "Half price."

Billy froze.
His hands jittered at his sides and he began babbling.
"I... I..." Slowly the cloud above his shoulders began to rescind.

I had seen this before.
I knew what was about to happen.
Slowly but surely, I began to make out more and more features of his face, which seemed all too...

"Grim."
Billy's eyes were diverted to my feet.
"I think I might need two coffins. Today's really not my day."

But it was mine.
Those two coffins would more than pay my rent for this month.

If I'm honest, I don't think I have ever truly developed empathy for other humans.
I look back at memories like these and wonder what people thought -- what they still think of me.
I have tried time and time again to see myself from the outside perspective, but it is just impossible.
I cannot even see myself in the mirror.

I know that I am statistically tall and thin.
I know my skin is pale and gait slightly askew.
I know I stand out.
I imagine everyone stares at me as I walk by, wondering to themselves about who I am, or worse: wondering if I will talk to them.

Honestly, I never cared what people thought.

Well, that's not entirely true.
I have had a few acquaintances throughout my life.
Some of those acquaintances, I would even call friends, although I still wonder if they thought the same of me.

I know this is a memoir, a collection of my memories, thoughts, and experiences, but at the same time, I feel this is just as much a story of the many people I have met throughout my life and how they have coped with the loss of their loved ones.

I know I have never been able to understand others, but this is in part because I have never truly tried.
Recent events have made me question whether I should.

I am currently writing, alone, bathed in the amber light of the late-afternoon.
Beams of light pierce through the otherwise empty room, illuminating small specks of dust flittering in the air.
The table before me is scattered with pages and pages of notes -- memories I have collected throughout the ages.

I suppose it's fitting that a man incapable of seeing other's expressions is also incapable of expressing himself.
I guess this is my first attempt to reach-out in the only way I know how: talking through my experiences and hoping someone, somewhere understands.
